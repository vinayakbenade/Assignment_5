# Student Marks Lookup

This is a simple Python script that allows you to look up the marks of students by their name.

## How It Works
- The script contains a dictionary called `student_dict` with student names as keys and their marks as values.
- When you run the script, it prompts you to enter a student's name.
- If the name exists in the dictionary, it prints the student's marks.
- If the name is not found, it prints "student not found".

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python Task1.py
   ```
3. Enter the student's name when prompted.

## Example
```
enter the student name: vinayak
vinayak's marks: 10
```

## Customization
- You can add more students and their marks to the `student_dict` as needed.
